T12768.hs:9:33: error: [GHC-39999]
    • Could not deduce ‘D [a]’
        arising from the coercion of the method ‘op’
          from type ‘D [a] => [a] -> [a]’ to type ‘D (N a) => N a -> N a’
      from the context: C a
        bound by the deriving clause for ‘C (N a)’ at T12768.hs:9:33
      or from: D (N a)
        bound by the method declaration for op at T12768.hs:9:33
      Possible fix:
        use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
          so you can specify the instance context yourself
    • When deriving the instance for (C (N a))
