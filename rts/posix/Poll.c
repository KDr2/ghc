/******************************************************************************

This I/O manager is based on the classic Unix poll() system call.

    int poll(struct pollfd *fds, nfds_t nfds, int timeout);

    struct pollfd {
       int   fd;         // file descriptor
       short events;     // requested events
       short revents;    // returned events
    };

The poll() function takes an array of struct pollfd, which specifies an fd and
a set of I/O events to check for. The poll() function checks each fd for the
resuested I/O events. The typical I/O events of interest are the ability to
read from the fd (POLLIN) or write to the fd (POLLOUT). The events that
occurred are returned in the revents member of the structure. Error events are
also reported.

This API is quite convenient and matches what we need to do quite nicely. In
particular it works with an array of fds rather than a set of fds (as select()
uses) which means array entries can correspond to operations by Haskell threads.
This is convenient because we can treat the operations by each Haskell thread
independently, rather than having to notice and keep track of different threads
being interested in the same fd. By contrast, the select() API is organised
around sets of fds, requiring the construction of a set of fds across all
threads, and later reversing the mapping from fds back to threads. Furthermore,
errors for each operation are reported separately, unlike with select() where,
for example, bad fds are reported as a single error result code from select(),
giving no indication of the fd involved.

So the approach we take for this I/O manager is to incrementally maintain an
array of struct pollfd, and to use it in each call to poll(). Each poll array
entry corresponds to a single active I/O operation (so no grouping by fd).

Note that this design decision to not group by fd is a performance trade off.
Not grouping by fd means that we do not have to incur the performance cost of
managing the aiop <-> fd mapping. On the other hand, if there are many threads
waiting on the same fd then we need multiple entries in the poll array, and
the kernel cost of poll() is proportional to the array length. If this happens
enough then the cost of using more poll array entries would outweigh the cost
of managing the aiop <-> fd mapping. The reason we choose not to group is that
in practice it's relatively rare for multiple threads to wait on the same fd.
Typically it's just one, or two (one for read, one for write). So it makes
sense to optimise for a small number of threads per fd. Conveniently this is
also the simpler design, which is nice.

The primary data structure for this I/O manager is a aiop_table which is
a ClosureTable of AsyncIOOps. This table tracks the active I/O operations, with
one entry per operation (corresponding to threads calling waitRead#/waitWrite#).
The aiop_poll_table is maintained as an auxiliary table to the aiop_table,
with table indexes matching the ClosureTable. So there is an entry in the
aiop_table for each operation, and a corresponding entry in the
aiop_poll_table at the same table index. The aiop_table and the aiop_poll_table
are maintained incrementally, and with dense indexes. Keeping the tables dense
makes for slightly cheaper calls to poll() (which cost O(nfds)) and cheaper
iteration over all active operations. We use a simple doubling strategy to
enlarge the tables, and never shrink.

We also use a StgTimeoutQueue to track timeouts, and use the delay to the next
timeout (if any) as the poll() timeout parameter.

The CapIOManager structure for this I/O manager contains:

    ClosureTable     aiop_table;
    struct pollfd   *aiop_poll_table;
    StgTimeoutQueue *timeout_queue;

We also support the Linux-specific ppoll API which supports higher resolution
time delays -- nanoseconds rather than milliseconds as in classic poll(). It
also allows the signal mask to be adjusted, but we do not make use of this.

   int ppoll(struct pollfd *fds, nfds_t nfds,
           const struct timespec *tmo_p, const sigset_t *sigmask);
