Version 9.10.2
==============
The significant changes to the various parts of the compiler are listed in the
following sections. See the `migration guide
<https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/migration/9.10>`_ on the GHC Wiki
for specific guidance on migrating programs to this release.

Language
~~~~~~~~



Compiler
~~~~~~~~

- Optimized lowering of BigNat# literals. (#23942, !12179)


JavaScript backend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



WebAssembly backend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


GHCi
~~~~

- When using XDG directories ``.ghci_history`` now uses the ``$XDG_DATA_HOME`` variable as expected. (#24266)

- Replaced some uses of lists with Arrays for better performance during bytecode compilation.

Runtime system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Memory return logic now uses live bytes rather than live blocks to measure the size of the heap.
  This primarily affects the non-moving GC, which should now be more willing to return memory to the OS.
  Users who have fine-tuned the :rts-flag:`-F ⟨factor⟩`, :rts-flag:`-Fd ⟨factor⟩`, or :rts-flag:`-O ⟨size⟩` flags,
  and use the non-moving GC, should see if adjustments are needed in light of this change.

- Reduce fragmentation incurred by the nonmoving GC's segment allocator. In one application this reduced resident set size by 26%. See :ghc-ticket:`24150`.
