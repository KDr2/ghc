.. _release-9-8-4:

Version 9.8.4
==============

The :ghc-flag:`LLVM backend <-fllvm>` of this release is to be used with LLVM
11, 12, 13, 14 or 15.

Significant Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issues fixed in this release include:

Compiler
--------

- :ghc-flag:`-Wmissing-home-modules` now behaves correctly when multiple units
  have expose the same module name (:ghc-ticket:`25122`).
- Adjust the demand signature of the ``prompt#`` to avoid invalid optimisation of
  non-terminating programs (:ghc-ticket:`25439`).

Packaging
---------

- Manual pages are now included in all binary distributions (:ghc-ticket:`24465`).

Other Core Libraries
--------------------

- The `filepath` library has been upgraded to 1.4.300.2, fixing a potentially
  exploitable behavior with `splitFileName` on Windows (:ghc-ticket:`24597`).

Included libraries
------------------

The package database provided with this distribution also contains a number of
packages other than GHC itself. See the changelogs provided with these packages
for further change information.
