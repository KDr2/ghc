Version 9.8.3
==============

The :ghc-flag:`LLVM backend <-fllvm>` of this release is to be used with LLVM
11, 12, 13, 14 or 15.

Significant Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issues fixed in this release include:

Compiler
--------

- Fixed a bug that caused GHC to panic when using the AArch64 ncg and :ghc-flag:`-fregs-graph`
  on certain programs (:ghc-ticket:`24941`).
- Fix invalid optimisation of Cmm programs on 32-bit platforms when targetting 64-bit targets (:ghc-ticket:`24893` and :ghc-ticket:`24700`)
- Improve float-out surrounding applications of ``runRW#`` (:ghc-ticket:`25055`)
- Fix :ghc-flag:`-fregs-graph` crash when targetting AArch64 (:ghc-ticket:`24941`)
- Fix native code generator miscompilation of signed sub-word arguments of FFI calls on x86 (:ghc-ticket:`25018`)
- Fix code generation of foreign exports with more than 6 arguments when some are subword-width (:ghc-ticket:`24314`)
- Fix recompilation avoidance behavior of :ghc-flag:`-fwrite-if-simplified-core` (:ghc-ticket:`24656`)
- Fix linking error when :extension:`TypeData` and :extension:`StrictData` are in use (:ghc-ticket:`24620`)
- Fix miscompilation by x86 native code generator due to shortcutting (:ghc-ticket:`24507`)
- Fix uses of ``(~)`` and ``(@)`` being rejected in :extension:`TemplateHaskell` splices (:ghc-ticket:`23748`)

Runtime system
--------------

- Significantly improve performance of code loading via dynamic linking (:ghc-ticket:`23415`)
- Internal fragmentation incurred by the non-moving garbage collector's allocator has been reduced for small objects.
  In one real-world application, this has reduced resident set size by about 20% and modestly improved run-time.
  See :ghc-ticket:`23340`.
  :rts-flag:`--nonmoving-dense-allocator-count=⟨count⟩` has been added to fine-tune this behaviour.
- Fix runtime crash of the :rts-flag:`nonmoving garbage collector <--nonmoving-gc>` due to weak pointers with static key (:ghc-ticket:`24492`)
- Allow heap profiling when the :rts-flag:`--nonmoving-gc` is in use

GHCi
----

- Fix a crash involving use of field selectors in GHCi (:ghc-ticket:`25109`)

JavaScript backend
------------------

- Fix compiler crash involving rubbish literals (:ghc-ticket:`25177`, :ghc-ticket:`24664`)

``base``
--------

- Bump version to 4.19.2.0
- Fix spurious closing of file descriptors after ``fork`` on platforms using the KQueue event manager backend (:ghc-ticket:`24672`)

Haddock
-------
- Fix source links to hyperlinked sources output (:ghc-ticket:`24086`)

Other Core Libraries
--------------------

- Bump ``stm`` to 2.5.3.1
- Bump ``deepseq`` to 1.5.1.0
- Bump ``array`` to 0.5.8.0
- Bump ``Cabal`` to 3.10.3.0
- Bump ``directory`` to 1.3.8.5
- Bump ``process`` to 1.6.25.0
